<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Marc</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Linux-Sysadmin from Cologne, Germany. I try to contribute to awesome open source projects.</h3>

<h4>A few facts about myself:</h4>

- 🏢 I manage VMware clusters, automate Linux environments using Ansible and SaltStack combined with Red Hat Satellite / SUSE Manager.
- 🖥️ I mostly use macOS, since I'm a macOS nerd and support the current ARM movement heavily!
- 🤑 My homelab consists of one NAS (Synology DS218+), a Raspberry Pi 4 and an old HP Thin Client (t520). It used to be a lot bigger but power costs in Germany are insane.
- 📷 In my free time I do a lot of photography, go to the gym, play badminton or travel the world.
- 📫 You can reach me here: **hello [at] marcsauer.net**

<h4>A few of my tech projects I did in my career until now:</h4>

- Concept and implementation of a disconnected DMZ environment using Proxmox and RHEL with high security needs
- Migration of a SLES environment with SUSE Manager to a complete new RHEL infrastructure with Red Hat Satellite (automation, patch- and configmanagement)
- Migration of a virtualization cluster from oVirt to Proxmox VE
- Architecture design and implementation of a 600+ users Nextcloud instance
- Implementation of Shibboleth (SAML) for a University with 600+ users
- Migration from Solaris 10 to Solaris 11 in a highly available environment (99,99%)
- Network infrastructure engineering (VLANs, firewalls, switches, routers)
- Migration of VMware vSphere clusters from version 6 to 7
- Implementation of an SMS alarm system for a datacenter
